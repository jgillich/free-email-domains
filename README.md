free-email-domains
---

A list of domains used by free email providers. Does not include [disposable email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_email_address). For that see the [disposable-email-domains](https://github.com/ivolo/disposable-email-domains) project.

For a domain to be included on the list it has to be:

- Free to register and to use by anyone (ie. not just a free trial)
- To have a valid MX record
- Not to appear in [disposable-email-domains](https://github.com/ivolo/disposable-email-domains)

We also include `hubspot-free-email-domains.txt` which are the domains listed in the [HubSpot KB](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/forms/what-domains-are-blocked-when-using-the-forms-email-domains-to-block-feature), however many of those domains are not listed by us as they don't fulfill the criteria above.

Freely usable under the MIT license.
